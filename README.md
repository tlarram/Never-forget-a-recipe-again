# Never-forget-a-recipe-again
## Welcome to My Cookbook! 

I created a web application to store recipes since my family loves to cook.  The first sprint includes creating a user based recipe database.  I also used the Spoonacular API to create recipes from items you have at home and can use in the recipe.  The API can also generate recipes if no food is provided so the user can see up to 5 recipes they may be interested in.  Who isn't looking for new things to try?

I like jokes, so there is a random food related joke each time that page loads.  

- Users can view, post, and add recipies to the database
- Create recipes based on items in the fridge or pantry
- Generate random recipes
- View a joke 
- Full CRUD for reciepes
- View all users recipes
